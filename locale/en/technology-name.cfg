[technology-description]
water-splitting=Extract hydrogen gas from water. The oxygen is wented in the process.
hydrogen-liquifaction=Turn hydrogen gas into a liquid. Can be used as a liquid fuel.
hydrogen-metallification=Turn hydrogen into a solid material. Can be burned as a solid fuel.
coal-enrichment=Increase the energy potential of coal.
fuel-enrichment=Increase the energy potential of solid fuel.
coal-hydrogen-liquefaction=Coal liquifaction with hydrogen infusion. Does not use any catalysts, just hydrogen and coal.
hydrogen-mod-fuel-cell=Pack hydrogen fuel into a dense cell for more speed, acceleration and no pollution.
hybrid-nuclear-fuel=Hybrid fusion/fission fuel cell.
